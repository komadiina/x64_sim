Use unsigned integers for address variables: Since you're working with an address space of 2^64, it's important to use unsigned integers to represent addresses, as signed integers may not be able to represent the entire address space.

Implement memory protection: To prevent accidental or malicious writes to critical system memory, it's a good idea to implement memory protection for addresses below 0x0000'0000'0000'FFFF, as you mentioned. This can be done using operating system mechanisms or hardware features such as memory protection keys.

Use efficient data structures for garbage collection: Garbage collection algorithms can be memory-intensive and time-consuming, so it's important to use efficient data structures and algorithms to minimize their impact on the system. For example, you could use a mark-and-sweep algorithm with a compacting step to reduce fragmentation in the heap.

Consider implementing memory pooling: Memory pooling is a technique where a fixed-size pool of memory chunks is pre-allocated and used for dynamic memory allocation, instead of allocating individual chunks from the heap. This can reduce the overhead of heap management and improve memory locality.

Test your simulator with large memory workloads: To ensure that your simulator can handle large memory workloads without crashing or slowing down, it's important to test it with realistic scenarios, such as programs that allocate and deallocate large amounts of memory, or programs that use recursion extensively.

Consider implementing a debugging interface: To aid in debugging and profiling your simulator, you could implement a debugging interface that allows you to inspect the contents of memory, the state of registers, and the call stack.

Use performance profiling tools: To identify performance bottlenecks in your simulator, you can use profiling tools such as perf or gprof, which can provide insights into where your simulator is spending the most time.
